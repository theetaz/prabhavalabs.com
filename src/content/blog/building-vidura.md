The best educational content on YouTube is overwhelmingly in English, and
for Sinhala speakers that language barrier turns a 20-minute lesson into
repeated rewinding. YouTube's auto-translated captions produce
word-by-word output that is effectively unreadable in Sinhala, and
commercial dubbing services do not cover the language.
[Vidura](https://vidura.prabhavalabs.com) addresses this directly: a
mobile-first PWA that fetches a video's transcript, translates it with an
LLM, and overlays synchronized Sinhala subtitles on the embedded player,
with a chat assistant grounded in the user's watch history. It is
self-hosted, and the two hardest problems were getting the transcript and
making the translation readable.

## Motivation

The initial implementation was straightforward: fetch the caption track
for a video ID, translate it, render it. It worked in local development
and failed immediately in production. The difference was the network
position of the server.

YouTube applies bot detection to requests from datacenter IP ranges, and a
low-cost VPS sits squarely inside them. The same request that succeeded
from a residential connection received a bot challenge from the server.
Rotating user agents, backoff, and cookie persistence did not change the
outcome, and structurally could not: from YouTube's perspective, a
datacenter server requesting caption tracks is indistinguishable from a
scraper.

## The transcript pipeline

*Figure 2: Transcript acquisition. The primary path uses YouTube's own caption track; audio transcription is the fallback.*

The production pipeline has two paths, ordered by timestamp quality:

- **Primary: yt-dlp through a paid residential proxy.** The request exits
  through a household ISP address and YouTube serves the caption track
  normally. This path is preferred because YouTube's own captions carry
  frame-accurate timestamps.
- **Fallback: audio transcription with Gemini.** When no proxy is
  configured or a video has no caption track, Vidura transcribes the
  audio. Timestamps from ASR land within roughly three seconds, which is
  adequate for following a lecture but visibly worse for subtitle sync.

The quality difference between the two paths motivated a product
decision: every video carries a provenance badge stating whether its
timestamps came from YouTube captions or from transcription, alongside a
computed sync score and the name of the translating model. When the data
is lower fidelity, the interface says so rather than presenting both
paths as equivalent.

## Translation as a single structured-output call

The first translation implementation iterated over caption cues and
translated each independently. Output quality was poor in a specific,
diagnosable way: terminology drifted (one English term became three
different Sinhala words across a lecture), sentences broke at cue
boundaries, and pronouns lost their referents. The root cause is that a
caption cue is not a sentence; it is wherever the speaker paused.
Translating cues independently is translating without context.

*Figure 3: Cue-by-cue translation versus whole-transcript translation.*

The production design inverts this: one structured-output call containing
the entire transcript plus the video title and description for grounding.
The model sees the full lecture before translating any line, so
terminology stays consistent from minute 2 to minute 40 and sentences flow
across cue boundaries. Two guardrails keep this safe. The core prompt is
immutable, so user-configurable tone settings cannot corrupt the output
format, and an alignment gate validates the result against the source cues
before anything is stored.

Whole-transcript calls are large, which made model routing an economic
requirement rather than a convenience. Vidura calls models through
OpenRouter: DeepSeek for near-zero marginal cost, GPT-class models when a
video warrants it. Switching is a settings change, not a code change. For
a self-funded system, that flexibility is what keeps the feature
economically viable.

## Grounded chat and the rest of the system

With accurate, translated transcripts in place, the remaining features
derive from the same data. The chat assistant answers questions grounded
in the transcripts of the user's library, citing video and timestamp.
Notes pin to playback positions. Subtitle rendering supports size, color,
background, and position adjustments, applied in fullscreen on both
orientations. The full stack is self-hosted: library, notes, and chat
history stay on the operator's server.

## Moving forward

Three engineering conclusions from this system. Infrastructure that
depends on YouTube requires a residential egress path; the polite
workarounds do not work and the proxy cost is the price of the feature.
Translation quality is a context problem before it is a model problem;
moving from per-cue calls to one whole-transcript call improved output
more than any model upgrade. And surfacing data provenance in the UI,
originally a debugging aid, became the feature users rely on to decide
how much to trust a video's subtitles.

Vidura is open source under
[Prabhava Labs](https://github.com/prabhavalabs/vidura). Current work
targets per-video glossaries for domain terminology and batch processing
for course playlists.
